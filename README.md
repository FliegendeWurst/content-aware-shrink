Reducing the size of images using seam carving. Based on the [paper](https://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf) by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.

## Example

In the animation below, the shrunk image is rescaled to the original height. It was created using `./generate_animation.sh` and [Rathaus Graz Turmblick](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:16-07-06-Rathaus_Graz_Turmblick-RR2_0275.jpg) by Ralf Roletschek (CC BY-SA AT 3.0):
